This project eliminated the need for three operators per shift across three shifts, significantly improving workplace safety and efficiency. Initially deployed on a high-volume production line, the solution was recognized as best-in-class and subsequently standardized across three additional lines within the facility. Its success led to global implementation across all manufacturing facilities for a leading automotive company.' },

The solution cross-referenced live stock levels with ERP data, automatically generating inventory adjustments and actionable reports to improve accuracy. By identifying discrepancies and streamlining corrections, this initiative enhanced inventory accuracy from 91% to over 96%, reducing stock variances, improving fulfillment reliability, and strengthening financial reporting.

Recognizing that cobot technology was still emerging within our industry, I initiated a comprehensive safety review, global company standard and approval process to mitigate risks and ensure regulatory compliance. Over a structured 12-month period, we successfully integrated the cobots, which not only streamlined operations and enhanced workplace safety but also set a precedent for automation within our organization. This pioneering project laid the groundwork for a global rollout across all diesel automotive manufacturing facilities, modernizing our production capabilities and driving operational excellence.' },

Leveraging optimized truckload plans from RXO Connect, this solution dynamically coordinated with all our 3PLs to ensure efficient order execution. The project not only streamlined transportation operations but also enhanced order accuracy and operational agility, setting a new standard for supply chain integration within the organization.' },
